# SingleCell-RNA-seq-Learning
This repo documents my practice in single-cell RNA-seq analysis, using 10X Genomics data to perform quality control, normalisation, dimensionality reduction (PCA/UMAP), and automated cell type assignment with cellassign. It is based on tutorials but adapted for clarity and deeper learning.
